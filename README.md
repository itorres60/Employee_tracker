This application serves the purpose of organizing an employee database for a client.

The data base is comprised of three tables (departments, roles, and employees).

The client has the ability to view the data within the database in an organized manner by role, department, or management.
The client also has the ability to manipulate the data to change management or roles.

This application makes use of many methods including SQL databases, Iquirere prompts, and console table formating.

In the JS code I have not hadcoded any lists besided the initial prompy question answer choices.  All of the other lists are populated through itteration of database information in order to keep results current to the addition and removal of any database information.  For example, if a new employee is added as a manager to other employees, then when viewing the employees by manager the new manager will be displayed as an option.  Therefore the prompt lists populate relevant options options based on database information.

I have refactored the codes several times to achieve this quality.

I have made use of asychronous functionality in order to allow the tables to populate before being reitroduced to the initial prompt.
